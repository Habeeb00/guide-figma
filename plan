# 📐 Frame Ruler Manager – Figma Plugin

A Figma plugin to manage **rulers inside frames**, making it easier to add, copy, and reuse guides across designs.

## 🎯 Goals
1- Extend Figma’s guide functionality to work at the **frame level**.
2- Allow designers to **add guides by precise values** (`px` or `%`).
3- Enable **copy-paste of guides** between frames.
4- Provide a **clear UI** to manage, show/hide, and delete rulers.
